# Objectives
The successful student will acquire a clear grasp of decision making processes in humans and computers, and their differences; understand the structure of modern heuristic search methods - search, knowledge and simulation, with machine learning as the main design tool; learn to make informed choices about which state of the art methods to use when designing a new decision-making program.

# Topics
Decision-making in humans and machines; search; knowledge; simulation; machine learning techniques for acquiring knowledge, including feature learning and neural networks.

Many Python 3 programs will be provided to illustrate algorithms and concepts. The running example is a series of programs to play the game of Go on a small 7x7 board.
